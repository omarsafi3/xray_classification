# Federated Learning Client Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file is for a SINGLE CLIENT running on THIS machine.
# Each hospital/facility has their own copy of this config.
#
# The FL Server runs on a REMOTE central server.
# Clients connect to it over the network.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Copy this file to each client machine
#   2. Set the data_path to the local dataset on that machine
#   3. Set the server address to the central FL server's IP/hostname
#   4. Run: python client.py --dataset_path /path/to/data
# =============================================================================

# This client's configuration
client:
  name: hospital1                    # Unique name for this client
  data_path: /path/to/local/dataset  # Local dataset path on THIS machine
  
# Central FL Server (running on remote machine)
server:
  # Replace with your actual server IP or hostname
  address: 192.168.1.100:8081        # Example: LAN IP
